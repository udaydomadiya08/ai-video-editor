PROVEN GITHUB UPLOAD CONFIGURATION
===================================

Date: 2026-02-09
Project: AI Video Editing Style Learning System

✅ TESTED & WORKING - Based on successful ai-video-editor push (108.47 MiB)

CRITICAL GIT CONFIGURATION (Run these BEFORE pushing):
-------------------------------------------------------

# 1. Increase buffer size to 1GB (handles large repos)
git config http.postBuffer 1048576000

# 2. Disable speed limits to prevent timeouts
git config http.lowSpeedLimit 0
git config http.lowSpeedTime 999999

# 3. Switch to HTTP/1.1 (CRITICAL FIX for large transfers)
git config --global http.version HTTP/1.1

# 4. Optimize compression
git config --global core.compression 9
git config --global pack.windowMemory 100m
git config --global pack.threads 1


STEP-BY-STEP UPLOAD PROCESS:
-----------------------------

1. CREATE GITHUB REPOSITORY:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Repository name: learn_fictic (or your choice)
   - Description: AI Video Editing Style Learning System
   - Keep it Public or Private
   - DO NOT initialize with README (we already have one)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. APPLY GIT CONFIGURATIONS:
   Run all the commands above in the project directory

3. ADD REMOTE & PUSH:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/learn_fictic.git
   git push -u origin main --progress

4. EXPECT:
   - Large upload may take 10-15 minutes
   - Progress will show after "Writing objects"
   - Transfer speed: ~15-20 MiB/s expected


REPOSITORY STATUS:
------------------
✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files committed locally (commit: initial commit)
✅ .gitignore configured (excludes data/, models/, venv/)
✅ Ready to push


KNOWN ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
-------------------------

Issue: "RPC failed; curl 16 Error in the HTTP2 framing layer"
Solution: Use HTTP/1.1 (already in config above)

Issue: Push hangs with no output
Solution: Increase postBuffer + use --progress flag

Issue: Network timeout
Solution: Disable speed limits (already in config above)


TRAINING STATUS AT TIME OF THIS NOTE:
--------------------------------------
- Training ongoing: Step 5 (Deep Style VAE)
- Runtime: 7h30m+
- No errors encountered
- Models saving to ./models/ (excluded from Git)


REFERENCE DOCUMENTS:
--------------------
- GITHUB_UPLOAD.md: Original upload instructions
- README.md: Project overview and usage
- WALKTHROUGH_BACKUP.md: Feature documentation backup


KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM SUCCESSFUL PUSH:
------------------------------------
✅ HTTP/1.1 is MORE RELIABLE than HTTP/2 for large repos
✅ Buffer size matters - 1GB prevents timeout issues
✅ Be patient - large uploads take 10+ minutes even after writing objects
✅ Use --progress flag to monitor upload status
